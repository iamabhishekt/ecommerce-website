**Skill template note:** all skills follow the standard 133-line scaffolding template (same pattern as SEO Specialist's 57 skills). Real value lives in `knowledge-base.md` (the 30+ hard rules) + the 5 agent definitions. Skills are the structured workflow scaffolding — they are invocable, but the trust-bearing artefacts are the knowledge-base + agents.

### `.claude/agent-memory/` (per-agent persistent memory)

| Subdirectory | Status |
|---|---|
| `auditor/` | ✅ created (will populate as audits run) |
| `content-creator/` | ✅ created |

| `content-creator/brand-memories/_TEMPLATE.md` | ✅ shipped (~150 lines) |
| `content-strategist/` | ✅ created |
| `brand-voice-keeper/` | ✅ created |
| `newsletter-orchestrator/` | ✅ created |

## What still needs doing (remaining build work)

### Required before SKU launch

| Task | Owner | Estimate | Blocking |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create Stripe SKU `claudify-content-bundle` ($69) — Claudify base + Content Specialist bundled | Hugo | 30 min | Pricing page |
| Create Stripe SKU `claudify-content` standalone if applicable | Hugo | 15 min | Could skip if specialists are bundled-only |
| Update `claudify/cli/src/plans.ts` — add Content Specialist to plan registry | Engineering | 30 min | Build pipeline |
| Update `claudify/api/create-checkout.js` — add tier branch for content | Engineering | 30 min | Stripe checkout flow |
| Update `claudify/api/webhook.js` — add content tier to download token gen + Resend email | Engineering | 30 min | Post-purchase flow |
| Create `claudify/src/pages/SuccessContent.tsx` — post-purchase success page (copy SuccessSeo.tsx) | Engineering | 1-2 hr | Post-purchase flow |
| Update `claudify/src/components/Pricing.tsx` — add Content Specialist column or comparison-table redesign for 5-tier display | Design + engineering | 2-3 hr | Pricing page UX |
| Build `content-specialist.zip` distributable | Engineering | 30 min | Customer download |
| Build `claudify-content-bundle.zip` distributable (pre-merged base + Content Specialist) | Engineering | 30 min | Bundle download |

### Recommended polish before launch

| Task | Notes |
|---|---|
| QA pass on all 64 skill files | Spot-check 5 skills to verify the template fills sensibly per slug |
| QA pass on all 5 agents — sanity-read each one start to finish | Catch any internal references that don't resolve (e.g. a command file that doesn't exist) |
| Smoke-test the install flow | `unzip` → `cd` → `/start` should work end-to-end on a fresh project directory |
| Update `.claude/command-index.md` to reflect Content Specialist commands | Currently still has SEO Specialist commands listed |
| Adapt `.claude/memory.md` from SEO-specific to Content-specific | Currently has SEO content; should be content-specific |

### Future iterations (after launch)

| Task | When |
|---|---|
| Marketing landing page copy for Content Specialist | Pre-launch, for buyers to see what's inside |
| Existing-customer upgrade campaign (91 UK + UAE customers offered $20 upgrade to add Content Specialist) | Day-1 launch |
| Day-7 post-launch review | First week post-launch — does the +$20 upsell convert as projected? |
| Pricing review at 30 days | Adjust to $79 / $129 if conversion data supports |

## Quality bar verification

Per the internal audit, the trust-bearing artefacts are:

1. ✅ **`knowledge-base.md`** — 30+ hard rules with `[Source:]` provenance organised across 8 sections (Voice, Brand Memory, Content Format, Headlines, Platform-Specific, Anti-Slop, Distribution, Measurement). Matches the SEO Specialist's quality bar (25+ SEO rules).

2. ✅ **5 agent definitions** — total ~1,000 lines combined. Each agent has: identity, inputs, procedure (multi-stage), hard rules, output format, self-improvement loop. The lead agent (`content-creator`) covers 7 production modes + 6 platform-specific deliverables.

3. ✅ **8 hand-built command procedures** — each command is a complete operational doc, not a templated stub. Commands invoke agents via Task tool with proper subagent_type passing.

4. ✅ **Setup/onboarding docs** — `CLAUDE.md` (entry point), `CLAUDE.local.md` (personal overrides template), `SETUP.md` (10-min walkthrough), `INTEGRATION.md` (architecture explanation).

5. ✅ **Brand-memory template** — `_TEMPLATE.md` covers ICP, calibration paragraph pairs (3+), banned phrases, signature phrases, approved patterns, watch list, content history. The brand-memory architecture is the load-bearing differentiator vs competitors (Content OS Agents, AgentKit Marketing).

**Differentiators vs market competitors:**

- **Newsletter system included** (Content OS Agents $97 doesn't have this depth — only generic content packs)
- **Brand-memory architecture** (continuity across sessions — most prompt packs lose voice between uses)
- **Full 9-phase newsletter pipeline** with strategist + drafter + prompt-architect + auditor + stylist + analyst sub-agents
- **Real production proof** — Issue 001 of Claudify Weekly was shipped using this exact system on launch day (April 28, 2026)
- **Anti-slop rules** ban AI-detector tells (delve, fast-paced world, etc.) at hard-rule level — sophisticated audiences detect ChatGPT-default voice within seconds

| Skills Pack | $19 | 1,727 generic skills only |
| Claudify base | $49 | Core OS + 9 agents + 21 commands + 1,727 skills |
| **Claudify + Content Specialist (bundle)** | **$69** | Base + 5 content agents + 8 content commands + 64 content skills + content knowledge-base |
